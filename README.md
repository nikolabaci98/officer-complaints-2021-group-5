The article published by Financial Times on May 28, 2021, one year after the death of George Floyd, tries to
analyse the complaints that are filed against police officers in three major cities: NYC, Chicago and Philadelphia. The article points out that the ten percent of the officer with the most complaints received a third
of all complaints during the period 2007-2017 for NYC and Chicago and 2015-2021 for Philadelphia. You can read more in the `article.pdf` in this repository or [here](https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e).

In this project, we aim to replicate these findings and achieve the same bar graphs as the article. In
addition, we further analyse the data according to variables such as the gender and race of the officers. This allows for exploration of the relationships between these variable and the complaints received.

In the `/data` directory you will find all the csv files that are used for this project for all three cities. Also, there are three shell files that you could run to download the necessary csv files. The command to run each file is `./filename.sh`.

The project is coded in R and `microsoft_project.Rmd` is the R Markdown notebook that contains this code. The `microsoft_project.html` is the rendered HTML version of the project.

Happy to hear any feedback or suggestion for the project.
